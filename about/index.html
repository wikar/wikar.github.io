title: About
---

<p>I currently work as Head of Business Intelligence & Analytics at the international beauty and health retailer <a href="http://www.lyko.com">Lyko</a>.</p>

<p>Ever since I first started programming at a young age I enjoyed the statistical and analytical bits the most and when I came in contact with the Analytics & Business Intelligence domain I found <em>home</em>.</p>

<p>As always the tools used are secondary to the value created but my preferred toolkit is the one from Microsoft where I also hold a number of certifications such as MCSE, MCSA, MCTS & MCITP in SQL Server and Business Intelligence.</p>
