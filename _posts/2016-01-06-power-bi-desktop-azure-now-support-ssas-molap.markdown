Ever since the possibility to create a data source connecting Power BI to an on-premises SSAS Tabular instance the same was [requested](https://ideas.powerbi.com/forums/265200-power-bi/suggestions/6606693-sql-server-analysis-services-cubes?tracking_code=3023dd7e6506a9e11f2a2fc1acddfe56) for Multidimensional (MOLAP) cubes and now the time has finally come!

Details on how to connect it through Enterprise Gateway can be found here: [Connect to SSAS Multidimensional Models in Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-desktop-ssas-multidimensional/) (Not updated yet to also include the Azure service)
