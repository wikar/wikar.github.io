The list below are my current goals to learn during the year (at least to an intermediate level).

1. [React](https://reactjs.org/)
1. [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
1. [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
1. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) / [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
1. [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
1. [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)
1. [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/)
1. [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) / [Azure ML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/)

So what's my reasoning behind learning these specific technologies?

Well, basically I would like to get up to scratch building modern web apps using the [MERN](https://www.apress.com/us/blog/all-blog-posts/why-mern/12056000) stack (switching out the [M](https://www.mongodb.com/) with Azure Cosmos DB since it has a [MongoDB API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-introduction)). Might as well have gone for [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) instead of [React](https://reactjs.org/) but the latter felt most intuitive based on my initial experience. Adding [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to be able to draw some nice looking charts in my applications.

Also adding a few .NET backend components to be able create analytical content with Azure Functions and ML.NET or Azure ML. I like the idea of a "headless architecture" where the front end (presentation) is separated/decoupled from the back end (content exposed through APIs).

I will try to combine most of the technologies from the list into one single project since that's the way I usually learn the best. Sources of learning are usually the official documentations of course, but I can also recommend [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)'s interactive online courses and [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/)'s books and videos (runs occasional sales where you can really make a deal).

Also writing this as a part 1 since I aim to create a follow-up (or many) during the year with my learning experiences.
