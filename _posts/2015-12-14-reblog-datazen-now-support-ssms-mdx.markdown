Since the latest release Datazen is now able to use MDX queries generated through SQL Server Management Studio. Christopher Finlan wrote about it is his blog post [New Datazen Server Build Brings some MDX Magic](http://christopherfinlan.com/2015/07/15/new-datazen-server-build-brings-some-mdx-magic/) and no use repeating the same here so I'll just post the link as a reblog.

Happy dashboarding!
